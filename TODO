Requirements
Handle click events:

When you click an attack button:

- update state variable(s) to make the Freaky Fungus lose hit points (HP), and to reduce your attack points (AP).
- See Attacks below, for the AP and HP values of each attack
- State may be held in one our more variables of your choosing
- HP and AP values may not be negative (set to zero, if they would otherwise be negative)

Render state changes to the DOM

- Update the text above the attack buttons (eg, "100 AP")
- Update the text above the enemy fungus (eg, "100 HP")
- If the Freaky Fungus runs out of HP, the monster is dead and you win! Replace the walk class with a dead class on the freaky-fungus element, to make them fall over and die.
- If you run out of AP, the monster wins and humanity is doomed ðŸ˜¢ Replace the walk class with a jump class on the freaky-fungus element, to make them jump for the glory of the fungal race.
- You may no longer attack, if AP is 0. Give all of the attack buttons a disabled attribute, so they may no longer be used.
